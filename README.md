Superfund Effect on Surrounding Community

Project Description:

	Superfund sites are heavily polluted sites contaminated with hazardous substances. These sites are intended to be investigated and cleaned by the EPA. However, the location of these sites tend to be in low income areas. We intend to look into the effects of these superfund sites on the surrounding community. We will look into three areas: household income, education level, and race.

	Is there a correlation between education level and proximity to the sites?
	Is there a correlation between race and proximity to the sites?
